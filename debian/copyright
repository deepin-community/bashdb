Upstream-Name: Bashdb
Upstream-Contact: Rocky Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>
Source: http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/
Comment: The upstream sources were repackaged in order to:
 drop the cruft that would be regenerated with the absolute path
 of the working directory.
 .
 The +ds tarball can be created using the repack.sh script (via
 repack.stub) and is automatically run on upgrade by uscan.
 This works best if the pkg-perl-tools is installed or at least
 if repack.sh from that package is in the PATH.
